# PiUI
Remote-controlling a RaspberryPi from Android via MQTT

This app was created at the DB HackDay on the 17th and 18th of June 2016.
It can be used to remote control your RaspberryPi via MQTT with your smartphone. Just type in some commands and see the results after the execution on the Pi. It works with PubSub, so you can even command multiple Pis with one command at the same time.
In order to work, you need to start a little Python script on the RaspberryPi which is included in this app. You can copy the script to your internal memory storage from within the app.
It also requires an MQTT broker, but it is preconfigured with a public broker from Deutsche Bahn.
